abstract = {Because the high biodiversity of Mexico about 12% of the country's total area is included as a Natural Protected Areas (NPAs); however, in the last years, according to the official data, an astonishing number of mining concessions covering 28% of the total area of the country has been granted already. The objective of this work is to quantify the geographical overlap of mining concessions with the federal NPAs of Mexico including the exploration/exploitation status of minerals to be extracted. We use geo-referenced polygons of the NPAs and those of mining exploration and exploitation concessions until 2010 and calculated their overlap extension with the application of ArcView GIS 3.3 (ESRI; Redland, CA, U.S.A.). Our results showed that a total of 1609 mining concessions covering an area of 1,486,433. ha geographically overlaps with the NPAs. With the exception of Natural Monuments (NM), all the different categories of NPAs in Mexico showed mining concessions; 75% of Natural Resources Protection Area (NRPA); 63% of Biosphere Reserve (BR); 47% of Protected Area for Flora and Fauna (PAFF); 22% of Sanctuary (S); and 15% of National Park (NP). The impacts of metal mining activities on NPAs are not only limited to biodiversity and affectation to human communities, but they also have a radius of influence not yet evaluated since most of the NPAs have a special role in supplying watersheds and aquifers. Obviously, currently in Mexico a NPA decree does not represent an obstacle to megamining projects; in consequence, their real environmental impacts are underestimated. It is a priority to legally support canceling the mining concessions already granted in the NPAs and stop granting new ones in the future. In the proportion to which environmental authorities continue to openly accept mining concessions within the NPAs, through modifying management programs that allow these activities, they may cause a significant increase in rejections of local people toward the changes in management programs and on the promotion of new NPAs in Mexico.},

abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species' range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Endemic and/or threatened species are often targeted to set conservation priorities. It is tempting to assume that a reserve network focusing on these species will be an effective umbrella for overall species richness of a country. For South Africa and Lesotho we tested whether complementary networks selected for threatened and/or endemic bird species satisfactorily represent all bird species, both in terms of capturing areas where other species are present or areas where they are more abundant (and, presumably, more viable). We found that areas selected for threatened and endemic species perform considerably better than areas selected at random. However, they do not guarantee the representation of overall bird species diversity, particularly not in peak abundance locations. Although nationally threatened and endemic species are important conservation targets, our results indicate that reserve networks focusing solely on these species may not be sufficient to preserve overall species diversity in a country.},

@article{Yin2017,
abstract = {There is mounting evidence that many taxa respond in non-linear ways to perturbation (i.e. deviations from a natural trajectory brought on by an external agent), and many statistical, physical and ecological methods have been developed to detect the critical points or thresholds of perturbation. The majority of these methods define thresholds as the perturbation points causing abrupt ecological response, but in reality most species or ecosystems do not show a break point response but more gradual transitional change to perturbation. We develop a new method which delineates thresholds as a region in which the slope of the relationship between ecological response (y) and perturbation (x; e.g. habitat loss) is larger than 1: |dy/dx|≥ 1, where both x- and y-axes are scaled to (0, 1) range. The lower end of threshold zones so defined is of particular ecological interest because it is the smallest x that may trigger impending catastrophic response to a small change in x. We derived two landscape models (edge length and the number of patches of species distribution) and two biodiversity models (endemics–area relationship and half-population curve) to test this method. We applied our zonal thresholding method to these four models fit to empirical data of two forest plots to detect thresholds of species distribution to habitat loss. The two landscape metric models predict that no species could tolerate more than 40% of habitat loss and these thresholds can be much lower for relatively rare species with occupancy < 0.4 and for aggregated habitat loss compared to random habitat loss. The half-population model leads to a similar threshold level of 40% habitat loss. Overall, we suggest the maximum permissible habitat loss threshold to be between 0–40%, depending on the pre-disturbed occupancy (or abundance) of a species. This habitat loss threshold falls within the otherwise wide range of thresholds calculated from conventional methods. Our study contributes novel methods and models to quantify the effect of habitat loss on species distribution and diversity in landscapes with potential for conservation applications.},

This was discovered in the southwestern province of the Persian Gulf, more specifically, in the harsh hyperarid intertidal zone separating the coastal ecosystem from the Middle East desert. Phylogenetic results based on the 16S rRNA gene indicate the existence of two new cryptic species within the Alpheus lobidens De Haan, 1849 species complex, described and named here as Alpheus qatari n. sp. and Alpheus arabicus n. sp. Furthermore, phylogeographic results suggest resurrection of Alpheus crassimanus Heller, 1865 within the same species complex. A phylogenetic comparison of the endemic Arabic goby Cryptocentroides arabicus (Gmelin, 1789) with some of its congeners confirms its presence along both sides of the Persian Gulf. Ecologically noteworthy is the facultative symbiotic interaction between this endemic Arabic goby with the two mentioned endemic alpheid shrimps within two distinct ecosystems. Therefore, we herewith report a case of exceptional symbiosis of a littoral fish species with two potential partners, niche-restricted to shallow intertidal zones, however, with niche differentiation defined by the adaptability of each associated shrimp species. Furthermore, the presence of the goby depends on suitable sediment needed for burrowing: either gravel in the periphery of coral reefs, or mud in the periphery of mangrove ecosystems. The corresponding ecology, taxonomic status and phylogeography are discussed with respect to the recorded facultative character of the symbiotic relationship.},

In this book Alan Grainger offers afresh analysis of the causes of deforestation and presents an integrated strategy for controlling it. His strategy embraces agriculture, forestry and conservation and stresses the need for changes in government policies if land use is to be made more sustainable and the underlying causes of the problem are to be addressed. Controlling Tropical Deforestation is essential reading for policy makers, agronomists, foresters, conservationists and development professionals. To general readers and students on introductory courses at schools and universities it also offers the first concise but comprehensive overview of the causes, scale and consequences of deforestation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre- and perinatal human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection remains one of the major causes of mental defects and sensineural hearing loss in children. In addition, it is a prominent infectious complication in immunosuppressed individuals such as AIDS patients or transplant recipients. Therefore, the development of an HCMV vaccine has been given top priority by health care institutions. STUDY DESIGN: Defective subviral particles of HCMV, termed Dense Bodies (DB) contain the dominant target antigens for humoral and cellular immune responses elicited during natural infection. These enveloped particles are released from infected culture cells and can be purified by gradient centrifugation. DB were analyzed for their ability to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) after immunization of mice. RESULTS: Purified DB entered human and murine hematopoetic and fibroblast cells very efficiently, thereby delivering their protein content into the cytoplasm. The cellular uptake was abrogated after sonication and freeze-thawing of the particles, indicating that the integrity of the viral envelope was important for this process. DB immunization of HLA-A2.K(b) transgenic mice induced significant CTL responses in the absence of viral gene expression and without the use of adjuvant. Induction of cytolytic cells by DB was sensitive to sonication and freeze-thawing as determined by CD3epsilon -redirected lysis analysis. In accordance with that, induction of virus neutralizing antibodies was much more effective when untreated DB were used as immunogen. CONCLUSIONS: DB provide a promising basis for the development of a subunit vaccine against HCMV infection. The ability to genetically engineer HCMV provides a rationale to optimize such a vaccine and to develop concepts for future multicomponent vaccines.},

abstract = {Increasingly, point-count data are used to estimate occupancy, the probability that a species is present at a given location; occupancy accounts for imperfect detection, the probability that a species is detected given that it is present. To our knowledge, effects of sampling duration on inferences from models of bird occupancy have not been evaluated. Our objective was to determine whether changing count duration from 5 to 8 min affected inferences about the occupancy of birds sampled in the Chesapeake Bay Lowlands (eastern United States) and the central and western Great Basin (western United States) in 2012 and 2013. We examined the proportion of species (two doves, one cuckoo, two swifts, five hummingbirds, 11 woodpeckers, and 122 passerines) for which estimates of detection probability were ≥ 0.3. For species with single-season detection probabilities ≥ 0.3, we compared occupancy estimates derived from 5- and 8-min counts. We also compared estimates for three species sampled annually for 5 yr in the central Great Basin. Detection probabilities based on both the 5- and 8-min counts were ≥ 0.3 for 40% ± 3% of the species in an ecosystem. Extending the count duration from 5 to 8 min increased the detection probability to ≥ 0.3 for 5% ± 0.5% of the species. We found no difference in occupancy estimates that were based on 5- versus 8-min counts for species sampled over two or five consecutive years. However, for 97% of species sampled over 2 yr, precision of occupancy estimates that were based on 8-min counts averaged 12% ± 2% higher than those based on 5-min counts. We suggest that it may be worthwhile to conduct a pilot season to determine the number of locations and surveys needed to achieve detection probabilities that are sufficiently high to estimate occupancy for species of interest.},

abstract = {Burrowing seabirds are important in ecological and conservation terms. Many populations are in flux due to both negative and positive anthropogenic impacts, but their ecology makes measuring changes difficult. Reliably recording key metrics, the proportion of burrows with breeding pairs and the success of breeding attempts requires burrow-level information on occupancy. We investigated the use of camera traps positioned at burrow entrances for determining the number of breeding pairs in a sample to inform population estimates, and for recording breeding success. The performance of two cameras makes we tested differed markedly, with Spypoint Force 10 trail cameras prone to malfunction while Reconyx HC600 Hyperfire cameras performed well. Nevertheless, both makes yielded season-long activity patterns for individual burrows, eliminating uncertainty around successful fledging attempts. Dimensionality reduction of activity metrics derived from camera time series suggests breeding and non-breeding burrows may be identifiable using linear discriminant analyses but sample sizes from our trial were low and group means were only significantly different during certain breeding stages (permutational multivariate analysis of variance: early chick-rearing f = 3.64, P = 0.06; late chick-rearing f = 8.28, P = 0.009). Compared with traditional techniques for determining burrow occupancy (e.g. manual burrow inspection and playback of conspecific calls at burrow entrances), camera traps can reduce uncertainty in estimated breeding success and potentially breeding status of burrows. Significant up-front investment is required in terms of equipment and human resources but for long-term studies, camera traps may deliver advantages, particularly when unanticipated novel observations and the potential for calibrating traditional methods with cameras are factored in.},

abstract = {Using publicly available data on land use and transportation corridors we calculated the human footprint index for the whole of Mexico to identify large-scale spatial patterns in the anthropogenic transformation of the land surface. We developed a map of the human footprint for the whole country and identified the ecological regions that have most transformed by human action. Additionally, we analyzed the extent to which (a) physical geography, expressed spatially in the form of biomes and ecoregions, compared to (b) historical geography, expressed as the spatial distribution of past human settlements, have driven the patterns of human modification of the land. Overall Mexico still has 56% of its land surface with low impact from human activities, but these areas are not evenly distributed. The lowest values are on the arid north and northwest, and the tropical southeast, while the highest values run along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and from there inland along an east-to-west corridor that follows the Mexican transversal volcanic ranges and the associated upland plateau. The distribution of low- and high footprint areas within ecoregions forms a complex mosaic: the generally well-conserved Mexican deserts have some highly transformed agro-industrial areas, while many well-conserved, low footprint areas still persist in the highly-transformed ecoregions of central Mexico. We conclude that the spatial spread of the human footprint in Mexico is both the result of the limitations imposed by physical geography to human development at the biome level, and, within different biomes, of a complex history of past civilizations and technologies, including the 20th Century demographic explosion but also the spatial pattern of ancient settlements that were occupied by the Spanish Colony.},

We test its existence and extension through a track analysis of beetle taxa, and discuss the implications of geographical homology. Location: The area analysed corresponds to the Caribbean subregion, which occupies Mexico, Central America, north-western South America, and the Western Indies. Methods: The panbiogeographic or track analysis was based in the comparison of 134 individual tracks belonging to different beetle taxa (species and supraspecific groups). A Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE) was applied in order to classify the areas by their shared taxa according to the most parsimonious cladogram, and the nested sets of areas were represented as generalized tracks. Results: Two generalized tracks resulted: (1) northern generalized track: comprising the Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Balsas Basin and Sierra Madre del Sur biogeographic provinces; and (2) southern generalized track: comprising the Chiapas, Mexican Gulf, Mexican Pacific Coast and western Panamanian Isthmus biogeographic provinces. Main conclusions: The generalized tracks obtained correspond broadly to Halffter's Nearctic and Mesoamerican patterns, respectively; however, in contrast to Halffter's Mesoamerican pattern, the southern generalized track extends further north through the lowlands of the Pacific and Mexican Gulf coasts.},

abstract = {Central America has high biodiversity, it harbors high-value ecosystems and it's important to provide regional climate change information to assist in adaptation and mitigation work in the region. Here we study climate change projections for Central America and Mexico using a regional climate model. The model evaluation shows its success in simulating spatial and temporal variability of temperature and precipitation and also in capturing regional climate features such as the bimodal annual cycle of precipitation and the Caribbean low-level jet. A variety of climate regimes within the model domain are also better identified in the regional model simulation due to improved resolution of topographic features. Although, the model suffers from large precipitation biases, it shows improvements over the coarse-resolution driving model in simulating precipitation amounts. The model shows a dry bias in the wet season and a wet bias in the dry season suggesting that it's unable to capture the full range of precipitation variability. Projected warming under the A2 scenario is higher in the wet season than that in the dry season with the Yucatan Peninsula experiencing highest warming. A large reduction in precipitation in the wet season is projected for the region, whereas parts of Central America that receive a considerable amount of moisture in the form of orographic precipitation show significant decreases in precipitation in the dry season. Projected climatic changes can have detrimental impacts on biodiversity as they are spatially similar, but far greater in magnitude, than those observed during the El Ni{\~{n}}o events in recent decades that adversely affected species in the region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Of the roughly 10 500 bird species currently recognized, 1 123 to 1 150 (11%) are found in Mexico, what ranks the country in the 11th position in bird species richness, and in 4th in the proportion of endemic species. Mexican avifauna is largely composed of resident species; however, migratory and transitory species are also important components. Similarly, a large proportion (77%) of the species breed in Mexico. Endemism levels are high: 194 to 212 species are included in some endemism category. Between 32-44% of the Mexican bird species has been rated with some level of threat according to national and international listings. Geographically, the highest species richness is located in contact areas between lowland and mountains in both slopes and along the lowlands of the in Gulf slope and the Yucatan Peninsula; endemism is mainly located in western Mexico: mainly along the Pacific slope and in mountains in the Transvolcanic Mexican Belt, the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Sierra Madre del Sur; in the Atlantic slope, endemism is higher along the Sierra Madre Oriental.},

abstract = {Modelling the distribution of human population based on satellite-derived information has become an important field of research, providing valuable input e.g. for human impact assessments related to the management of threatened ecosystems. However, few regional-scale studies have been conducted in developing countries, where detailed land cover data is usually absent, and the potential of very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery in this context has not been explored yet. This study uses results obtained through object-based image analysis (OBIA) of QuickBird imagery for a subset of a highly populated rural area in western Kenya. Functions are established that approximate frequency distributions of QuickBird-derived locations of houses in relation to five factors. These factors are known to impact settlement patterns and data is available for the entire study area. Based on an overall probability coefficient (weight) calculated from the single functions, human population is redistributed at the smallest administrative level available (version A). In addition, the problem of artefacts remaining at administrative boundaries is addressed by combining the approach with the pycnophylactic smoothing algorithm (Tobler, 1979) (version B). The results show distinct patterns of population distribution, with particular influence of rivers/streams and slope, while version B in addition is free of boundary artefacts. Despite some limitations compared to models based on detailed land cover data (e.g. the ability of capturing abrupt changes in population density), a visual and numerical evaluation of the results shows that using houses as classified from VHR imagery for a study area subset works well for redistributing human population at the regional level. This approach might be suitable to be applied also in other regions of e.g. sub-Saharan Africa. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Context: Climate change is not occurring over a homogeneous landscape and the quantity and quality of available land cover will likely affect the way species respond to climate change. The influence of land cover on species' responses to climate change, however, is likely to differ depending on habitat type and composition. Objectives: Our goal was to investigate responses of forest and grassland breeding birds to over 20 years of climate change across varying gradients of forest and grassland habitat. Specifically, we investigated whether (i) increasing amounts of available land cover modify responses of forest and grassland-dependent birds to changing climate and (ii) the effect of increasing land cover amount differs for forest and grassland birds. Methods: We used Bayesian spatially-varying intercept models to evaluate species- and community-level responses of 30 forest and 10 grassland birds to climate change across varying amounts of their associated land cover types. Results: Responses of forest birds to climate change were weak and constant across a gradient of forest cover. Conversely, grassland birds responded strongly to changing climatic conditions. Specifically, increasing temperatures led to higher probabilities of localized extinctions for grassland birds, and this effect was intensified in regions with low amounts of grassland cover. Conclusions: Within the context of northeastern forests and grasslands, we conclude that forests serve as a possible buffer to the impacts of climate change on birds. Conversely, species occupying open, fragmented grassland areas might be particularly at risk of a changing climate due to the diminished buffering capacity of these ecosystems.},

This study investigates the distribution of tree cover in the eastern part of China in 2010, and how it is related to climate, topography, and anthropogenic pressure. We use random forest modeling of remote sensing data for tree cover, together with data for topography, climate, and anthropogenic pressure. Our results show that 2,136,000 km 2 had tree cover ≥25% in the eastern part of China in 2010 and that the areas with high tree cover were mainly distributed in north-eastern, southern, and south-central China. The variable that best explains the distribution of tree cover is actual evapotranspiration followed by slope and population density. The association between slope and tree cover increases as population density rises, suggesting that the association may be influenced by anthropogenic land use intensity and that slopes act as refugees for forests. Our study emphasizes the need to pay attention to the association between slope and tree cover and especially to the anthropogenic factors that, entirely or to some extent, drive this association.},

An experimental transect encompassing the major community and soil types along a steep, west-facing vegetated dune was established. Maximum available water was shown to be significantly higher in the fine textured surface soils of the lowland sites than the coarse textured sands of the dune sites. Seasonal (1979) patterns of available soil moisture of the sampling sites on the transect showed that in the upper elevation dune sands, moisture was available in the entire profile with surface depletions not occurring until mid to late summer. In contrast, moisture in the surface 60–80 cm in the fine textured lowland soils was exhausted by early to mid-summer with the entire profile nearly dry by late summer. Deep-rooted, C4 species, Andropogon hallii and Calamovilfa longifolia which are common on upper, coarser sandy soils showed significantly greater water stress on fine textured soils than on dune sands. C3, shallowrooted species, Agropyron smithii, Stipa comata, and Koeleria cristata always experienced lower mid-day and predawn leaf water potentials than the C4 species. The C3 species, with the exception of Koeleria are most abundant on finer textured soils that provide substantial moisture during their peak activity in the spring. It appears that the C4 species show more conservative water use patterns than the C3 species as significantly lower leaf conductances in the C4's were measured when soil water was abundant. The C3 species appear to be opportunistic with available water and rapidly deplete surface soil moisture as a result of high transpiration rates. These data suggest that the temporal and spatial distribution of available water along this gradient controls species distribution according to rooting morphology, photosynthetic physiology, and water deficits, incurred by transpirational losses. Competitive interactions between species that utilize soil moisture differently may be an important factor in community organization.},

abstract = {Conservationists have proposed methods for adapting to climate change that assume species distributions are primarily explained by climate variables. The key idea is to use the understanding of species-climate relationships to map corridors and to identify regions of faunal stability or high species turnover. An alternative approach is to adopt an evolutionary timescale and ask ultimately what factors control total diversity, so that over the long run the major drivers of total species richness can be protected. Within a single climatic region, the temperate area encompassing all of the Northeastern U.S. and Maritime Canada, we hypothesized that geologic factors may take precedence over climate in explaining diversity patterns. If geophysical diversity does drive regional diversity, then conserving geophysical settings may offer an approach to conservation that protects diversity under both current and future climates. Here we tested how well geology predicts the species diversity of 14 US states and three Canadian provinces, using a comprehensive new spatial dataset. Results of linear regressions of species diversity on all possible combinations of 23 geophysical and climatic variables indicated that four geophysical factors; the number of geological classes, latitude, elevation range and the amount of calcareous bedrock, predicted species diversity with certainty (adj. R2 = 0.94). To confirm the species-geology relationships we ran an independent test using 18,700 location points for 885 rare species and found that 40% of the species were restricted to a single geology. Moreover, each geology class supported 5–95 endemic species and chi-square tests confirmed that calcareous bedrock and extreme elevations had significantly more rare species than expected by chance (P<0.0001), strongly corroborating the regression model. Our results suggest that protecting geophysical settings will conserve the stage for current and future biodiversity and may be a robust alternative to species-level predictions.},

Ary Hoffmann and Carla Sgr{\`{o}} review the evidence for evolutionary adaptation in response to recent climate change and consider the implications for population and ecosystem management. Evolutionary adaptation can be rapid and potentially help species counter stressful conditions or realize ecological opportunities arising from climate change. The challenges are to understand when evolution will occur and to identify potential evolutionary winners as well as losers, such as species lacking adaptive capacity living near physiological limits. Evolutionary processes also need to be incorporated into management programmes designed to minimize biodiversity loss under rapid climate change. These challenges can be met through realistic models of evolutionary change linked to experimental data across a range of taxa.},

Because elements of biodiversity respond intimately to climate as an important driving force of distributional limitation, distributional shifts and biodiversity lossess are expected. Nevertheless, in spite of modelling efforts focused on single species or entire ecosystems, a few preliminary surveys of fauna-wide effects, and evidence of climate change-mediated shifts in several species, the likely effects of climate change on species' distributions remain little known, and fauna-wide or community-level effects are almost completely unexplored. Here, using a genetic algorithm and museum specimen occurrence data, we develop ecological niche models for 1, 870 species occurring in Mexico and project them onto two climate surfaces modelled for 2055. Although extinctions and drastic range reductions are predicted to be relatively few, species turnover in some local communities is predicted to be high (s>40% of species), suggesting that severe ecological perturbations may result.},

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (∼18%) than mid-range (∼24%) and maximum-change (∼35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Glaciers serve as early indicators of climate change. Over the last 35 years, our research team has recovered ice-core records of climatic and environmental variations from the polar regions and from low-latitude high-elevation ice fields from 16 countries. The ongoing widespread melting of high-elevation glaciers and ice caps, particularly in low to middle latitudes, provides some of the strongest evidence to date that a large-scale, pervasive, and, in some cases, rapid change in Earth's climate system is underway. This paper highlights observations of 20th and 21st century glacier shrinkage in the Andes, the Himalayas, and on Mount Kilimanjaro. Ice cores retrieved from shrinking glaciers around the world confirm their continuous existence for periods ranging from hundreds of years to multiple millennia, suggesting that climatological conditions that dominate those regions today are different from those under which these ice fields originally accumulated and have been sustained. The current warming is therefore unusual when viewed from the millennial perspective provided by multiple lines of proxy evidence and the 160-year record of direct temperature measurements. Despite all this evidence, plus the well-documented continual increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, societies have taken little action to address this global-scale problem. Hence, the rate of global carbon dioxide emissions continues to accelerate. As a result of our inaction, we have three options: mitigation, adaptation, and suffering.},

abstract = {Climate change-driven modifications in thermal and precipitation patterns can result in shifts in species distributions. Avian species in humid mountain forests (HMF) are among the most vulnerable to these atmospheric changes. In this study, we assessed the extent to which climate change could cause distribution shifts in 34 bird species spatially restricted to HMF ecosystems in Mexico. In addition, we analyzed the representation of the species in protected areas (PAs) and the extension these areas covered in the entire range of each species. Species distribution models (SDMs) were generated using Maxent algorithm. Future SDM scenarios were considered using two scenarios: The Interdisciplinary Climate Research Model (MIROC5) and The Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) with a single representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0). We found that by 2050, under MIROC5, modeled species distributions showed an average reduction of 34%, and under CCSM4, a decrease of 40%. By 2070, MIROC5 showed an average a reduction of 51% and under CCSM4 of 54%. SDMs for 20 species overlapped with protected areas (PA), although nine species would reduce their presence in the PAs by 2050 under MIROC5 and 11 under CCSM4. By 2070, 11 and 12 species respectively for both scenarios, would reduce their distribution range in the PAs. More than 94% of the bird species considered, have less than 10% of their distribution in PAs in the current and future scenarios. The species distribution models of 14 species, particularly those of small range, showed no overlap with any PA under the current or future scenarios. To ensure that HMF endemic bird species are represented in different protected areas in the future, conservation schemes such as protected social and community areas and biological corridors could be valuable in ensuring the conservation of endemic birds in the long-term, especially in those regions underrepresented by PAs.},

abstract = {We used an integrated modeling approach to simulate future land cover and predict the effects of future urban development and land cover on avian diversity in the Central Puget Sound region of Washington State, USA. We parameterized and applied a land cover change model (LCCM) that used output from a microsimulation model of urban development, UrbanSim, and biophysical site and landscape characteristics to simulate land cover 28 years into the future. We used 1991, 1995, and 1999 Landsat TM-derived land cover data and three different spatial partitions of our study area to develop six different estimations of the LCCM. We validated model simulations with 2002 land cover. We combined UrbanSim land use outputs and LCCM simulations to predict changes in avian species richness. Results indicate that landscape composition and configuration were important in explaining land cover change as well as avian species response to landscape change. Over the next 28 years, urban land cover was predicted to increase at the expense of agriculture and deciduous and mixed lowland forests. Land cover changes were predicted to reduce the total number of avian species, with losses primarily in native forest specialists and gains in common synanthropic species such as the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). The integrated modeling framework we present has potential applications in urban and natural resource planning and management and in assessing of the effects of policies on land development, land cover, and avian biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Tropical landscapes are dominated by land-use systems, but their contribution to the conservation of biodiversity is largely unknown. Since changes in biodiversity in response to human impact are known to differ widely among taxonomic groups and guilds, there is a need for multidisciplinary collaboration of plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate experts. We used inventories of trees, understory plants, birds (subdivided into endemics, insectivores, frugivores/nectar feeders), butterflies (endemics, fruit feeders), and dung beetles in Sulawesi (Indonesia) to characterize a gradient from near-primary to secondary forests, agroforestry systems, and annual crops. As expected, overall species richness tended to decrease within this gradient of increasing habitat modification, but, in contrast to previous studies, we found the species richness between most taxonomic groups to be significantly correlated (36 out of 38 pairwise comparisons). However, on average only 48% of the variance could be explained (within the five main groups), and only a few taxonomic groups/guilds turned out to be good predictors for others: for example, trees for fruit- and nectar-feeding birds (88% explanation) and fruit-feeding butterflies (83%), endemic birds for endemic butterflies (72%), and frugivorous/nectar-feeding birds for fruit-feeding butterflies (67%). Although biodiversity of land-use systems showed taxonomic group- and guild-specific differences, most groups were affected in a similar way by habitat modification. Near-primary forest sites proved to be of principal importance for conservation; however, land-use systems such as secondary forests (for understory plants, birds, and butterflies) and agroforestry systems (for butterflies) supported relatively high numbers of species and might play a significant role for biodiversity conservation in tropical landscapes.},

abstract = {Land-use/land-cover change is the most important factor in causing biodiversity loss. The Mediterranean region has been affected by antropic disturbance for thousands of years, and is, nowadays, one of the most significantly altered hotspots in the world. However, in the last years a significant increase in forest cover has been measured. These new patterns are independent from planned conservation strategies and appear to have a substantial impact on landscapes and biodiversity. We used three land-use/land-cover maps (from 1960 to 2000) covering the Italian peninsula to analyze the pattern of land-use/land-cover change. We measured an increase in forests, especially in mountains, an increase in artificial areas, especially in coastal zones, and a decrease in pastures. Intensively cultivated areas showed a limited decrease while extensively cultivated ones showed a marked decrease. In the same period mammal and bird species followed a similar pattern, with forest birds, ungulates and carnivores increasing, and typically Mediterranean species decreasing. We suggest that our results may provide important information, which could be useful for conservation planning in the entire Mediterranean hotspot. We suggest that an increasing conservation effort should be made to protect the Mediterranean-type forests and scrublands, as well as traditional agricultural practices. Moreover, future conservation efforts should consider the broad socio-political and ecological processes that are most likely to occur across the whole hotspot, especially along coastal areas, and the network of protected areas should be functionally integrated in a conservation strategy that includes the human-dominated landscape. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

Increasing impacts are expected for the future, yet few studies have aimed for a general understanding of the regional basis for species vulnerability. We projected late 21st century distributions for 1,350 European plants species under seven climate change scenarios. Application of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List criteria to our projections shows that many European plant species could become severely threatened. More than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080. Expected species loss and turnover per pixel proved to be highly variable across scenarios (27-42% and 45-63% respectively, averaged over Europe) and across regions (2.5-86% and 17-86%, averaged over scenarios). Modeled species loss and turnover were found to depend strongly on the degree of change in just two climate variables describing temperature and moisture conditions. Despite the coarse scale of the analysis, species from mountains could be seen to be disproportionably sensitive to climate change (≈60% species loss). The boreal region was projected to lose few species, although gaining many others from immigration. The greatest changes are expected in the transition between the Mediterranean and Euro-Siberian regions. We found that risks of extinction for European plants may be large, even in moderate scenarios of climate change and despite inter-model variability.},

abstract = {Analysis of changes in functional groups of species and potential drivers of environmental change for protected areas across the world's major tropical regions reveals large variation between reserves that have been effective and those experiencing an erosion of biodiversity, and shows that environmental changes immediately outside reserves are nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate. Protected areas are a key component of tropical forest conservation strategy, but how well are they performing? These authors assemble a large data set from 60 protected areas across the globe, assessing 31 functional groups of species and 21 drivers of environmental change. They find that about half of the reserves are succeeding but half are experiencing substantial losses of biodiversity, driven as much by environmental change outside the reserves as by change within them. To protect what remains of these habitats, the authors suggest that it is vital to establish sizeable buffer zones around reserves, maintain substantial reserve connectivity to other forest areas and promote low-impact land uses near reserves. The rapid disruption of tropical forests probably imperils global biodiversity more than any other contemporary phenomenon1,2,3. With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses4,5,6,7,8,9. As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas stratified across the world's major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve ‘health': about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious biodiversity declines.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, interest in species distribution models (SDMs) of plants and animals has grown dramatically. Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The geomorphic structure of Central cordillera in Antioquia departament of Colombia consists of a mosaic of first order landforms: uplifted etchplains, regional scarps, linear and branched canyons and the Aburra valley as an intramontane basin. Etchplains and regional scarps are spatially arranged as stepped patterns; lineal and branched canyons correspond to the youngest first order generation in the Colombian Central range and they are modelled simultaneously with the final Colombian north cordillera uplift. The Aburra valley is a unique type relief, not only on the northern of the Central cordillera but for all the Colombian Andes.The Santa Rosa de Osos etchplain is distinguished from the others stepped etchplains by the preservation of old (tertiary) relief types, relief elements, landforms and soils.},

@article{Velasquez-Tibata2013,
abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause shifts in species distributions worldwide, threatening their viability due to range reductions and altering their representation in protected areas. Biodiversity hotspots might be particularly vulnerable to climate change because they hold large numbers of species with small ranges which could contract even further as species track their optimal habitat. In this study, we assessed the extent to which climate change could cause distribution shifts in threatened and range-restricted birds in Colombia, a megadiverse region that includes the Tropical Andes and Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena hotspots. To evaluate how climate change might influence species in this region, we developed species distribution models using MAXENT. Species are projected to lose on average between 33 and 43 % of their total range under future climate, and up to 18 species may lose their climatically suitable range completely. Species whose suitable climate is projected to disappear occur in mountainous regions, particularly isolated ranges such as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Depending on the representation target considered, between 46 and 96 % of the species evaluated may be adequately represented in protected areas. In the future, the fraction of species potentially adequately represented is projected to decline to 30-95 %. Additional protected areas may help to retain representativeness of protected areas, but monitoring of species projected to have the largest potential declines in range size will be necessary to assess the need of implementing active management strategies to counteract the effects of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},
